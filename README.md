# Redocusaurus

Redoc for Docusaurus v2

We use Redoc for rendering OpenAPI files. See this issue, <https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/issues/638>, and this gist, <https://gist.github.com/rohit-gohri/b1a19f37702cfe4a6c5a47933a11785b> for more details on the customizations.

The project is divided into 2 parts:

## Docusaurus Theme Redoc

A wrapper around RedocStandalone to make it match the Dcousaurus Theme.

## Docusaurus Plugin Redoc

A content plugin that creates pages from your OpenAPI files or URLs.
